#Research Interests
My research interests include (real-time) RGB-D based 3D Reconstruction, Visual SLAM, Visual Odometry, Shape-from-Shading and Bundle Adjustment techniques. Please visit my publication page to find out more about my research.

#Brief Bio
I have joined the Computer Vision Group at TUM in May 2014 as a research assistant and doctorate candidate. In 2016/2017, I stayed several months as a Computer Vision Research Intern at NVIDIA Research in Santa Clara, CA (USA). From 2013 to 2014 I worked as a Computer Vision Engineer for medical imaging and RGB-D based 3D reconstruction at ImFusion (Munich).
I have received my Bachelor’s degree (2010) and my Master’s degree (2013, with distinction) in Computer Science from the Technical University of Munich (Germany). During my Master’s studies, I spent an exchange semester at UPC Barcelona (Spain) in 2011/2012, before I worked as a Computer Vision Research Intern for RGB-D based 3D reconstruction at Siemens Corporate Research in Princeton, NJ (USA) in 2012/2013. Moreover, I have a Computer Science Expert degree and many years experience of working as a Software Engineer. Please have a look at my CV for more information.
